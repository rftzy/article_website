Data structure is a way of organizing and storing data so that it can be accessed and used efficiently. It refers to the logical or mathematical representation of data, as well as the implementation in a computer program.

Data structure can be broadly classified into two categories:

**Linear Data Structure**

A linear data structure is a data structure in which elements are arranged in a sequential order, with each element connected to previous and next element.

Example: Array, Stack, Queue, Linked List

**Non-Linear Data Structure**

A non-linear data structure is a data structure in which elements are not arranged in a sequintal order. Instead, they are connected to each other in a hierarchial or network-based structure.

Example: Tree, Graph, Heap
