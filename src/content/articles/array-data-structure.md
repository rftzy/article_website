An array is a linear data structure that stores a collection of elements of the same data type in contiguous memory locations. This means that all of elements of an array are stored next to each other in memory.

Each element in an array has a unique index, which is used to access that element.

All of the elements in an array must be in of the same data type. This is because the elements of an array are stored in contiguous memory locations, and the computer need to know how much space to allocate for each element.

**Operations**

* Add a new element to the array.
* Remove an element from the array.
* Find a specific element in the array.
* Changing the value of an element in the array.
